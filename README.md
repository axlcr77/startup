Yes!

Notes: 
in order to get to the correct directory type cd on its own first.
git commit and then git push to update the github repository.

Elevator pitch:
A good study strategy is repetition and self-testing. Creating a website/app that allows a user to store the topics they learn in school so that they can be reviewed a certain amount of time later for maximum retention. Website would also include random testing as this has also shown that it increases understanding.

Key Features:
User would be able to write the topics they learn. Specify which parts are important, relevant for the test, relevant for the homework, etc. They can specify which questions to be asked for the random testing.

Start up Notes:
- Using the properties of bootstrap to change color, font, etc.
    
    if there are spaces then use “.” in between
    

If something is not working then just create a class of their own and edit that in CSS

To see bootstrap’s classes just use the developer tools on the website and the templated pages
